What is *euromod*?
==================

The Euromod Connector for Python is built to facilitate and simplify the usage of the [EUROMOD](https://euromod-web.jrc.ec.europa.eu "https://euromod-web.jrc.ec.europa.eu") microsimulation model for research and analysis purposes. 

EUROMOD is a tax-benefit microsimulation model for the European Union that enables researchers and policy analysts to calculate, in a comparable manner, the effects of taxes and benefits on household incomes and work incentives for the population of each country and for the EU as a whole. It is a static microsimulation model that applies user-defined tax and benefit policy rules to harmonised microdata on individuals and households, calculates the effects of these rules on household income.
